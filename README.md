# AmericanOptionPricing
## Abstract:

Option pricing is a well covered area, with many approaches available. One of the best
known methods for pricing of options was proposed by Cox, Ross, and Rubenstein in 1979:
the binomial tree model. Their approach works well for both European options and American
options, but has to be tweaked for American options, to allow for the possibility of early exercise.
After reviewing the pricing of European options on binomial tree models, this project proceeds
with studying the pricing of American options, and provides a method for visualising how the
value of the option evolves within the model.
